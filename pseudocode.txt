Based off the original Caesar's cipher's program that I have created:
Added features:
1. Allow the user to type in a string as the key
2. Run through this string, comparing it to the alphabet and adding in the string's letter's corresponding position in the alphabet. This will be the key.
3. When ciphering the text, run through the key and cipher each letter with each letter of the key. 
4. If the cipher text is longer than the key, run through the key once more until all remaining letters are ciphered. 
5. Done!
